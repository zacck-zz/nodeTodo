Hello!

My name is Zacck Osiemo  and Iâ€™m independent contractor running a group of startups working to produce edgy immersive experiences using platforms such as VR, the web and much more.
I would like to hold some talks in the interest of gaining peers to work with while also showcasing services that I provide to clients.
I am a software engineer by training currently very interested in interacting with others mostly about testing and building performant applications.  I blog at https://medium.com/quick-bytes

Thank you so much for considering this.  Kind Regards  Zacck

Thank you so much for taking your time to consider this.
